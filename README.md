# Arweave-Hackathon-Project
A project utilising the functionality of Arweave

INTRODUCTION

This is a project built for the Arweave Hackathon held between 28th July and August 8th.2023. These are some of the initial ideas I was considering:

- Build a permaweb app that lets musicians issue Universal Data Licensed tracks, and lets users listen to them, as well as buy into them and trade their revenue streams.

- Build an open forum on Arweave as a permaweb app, where users can buy into each other's content to show their support for interesting posts. The 'sponsors' (tokenholders) of a post could be shown as a pie chart next to the post to highlight this component of the experience.

- Build an open youtube-style platform on Arweave that lets users browse for videos, tip creators, and buy into the revenue streams for content -- all of which can be licensed with the UDL.
